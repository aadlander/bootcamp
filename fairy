Fairy:
Hello my name is Fairy.
I am your fairy godparent.
I can grant you three wishes.
What will they be child?
Not-Child-Person:
I wish for a spoon,
I wish for a mud puddle to dump my sister in,
and I wish for all the tea in China.
Fairy:
Child, I will grant you a spoon and all the tea in China, 
but I cannot use my magic to let harm come to any children 
even your sister.
Not-Child-Person:
I'm not a child and neither is she... does that help?
Fairy:
All people on this planet are children when compared to the
age of the Universe.
Not-Child-Person:
How about you just make a the puddle and I take care of the rest,
or just make it rain wherever she is for the next week.
On the whole that's good right?
Plants need water so I'm just helping the environment.
