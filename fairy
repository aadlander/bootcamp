Hello my name is Fairy.
I am your fairy godparent.
I can grant you three wishes.
What will they be child?
I wish for a spoon,
I wish for a mud puddle to dump my sister in,
and I wish for all the tea in China.
Child, I will grant you a spoon and all the tea in China, 
but I cannot use my magic to let harm come to any children 
even your sister.
I'm not a child and neither is she... does that help?
