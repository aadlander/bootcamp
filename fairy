Fairy:
Hello my name is Fairy.
I am your fairy godparent.
I can grant you three wishes.
What will they be child?

Not-Child-Person:
I wish for a spoon,
I wish for a mud puddle to dump my sister in,
and I wish for all the tea in China.

Fairy:
Child, I will grant you a spoon and all the tea in China, 
but I cannot use my magic to let harm come to any children 
even your sister.

Not-Child-Person:
I'm not a child and neither is she... does that help?

Fairy:
All people on this planet are children when compared to the
age of the Universe.

Not-Child-Person:
How about you just make a the puddle and I take care of the rest,
or just make it rain wherever she is for the next week.
On the whole that's good right?
Plants need water so I'm just helping the environment.

Fairy:
If your wish is to make it rain, then I will grant your wish child. 
However, I will only grant it if you promise to be kind to your sister.
Also in payment for these three wishes I need you to go and catch the 
evil magic dweller who lives on the top of Mt. Olympus for me.  

Not-Child-Person:
Well I guess Zeus is an ass so I'll go ahead and take care of him.
Do you have anything to help with that?
I don't think I can manage it on my own.

Fairy:
You will have the three wishes that you asked for: a spoon, all the tea
in China, and the rain.  All you have to do is think about the paricular
wish you want to use and it will be granted.  Good luck. 

Narrator:
With a poof the fairy is gone.

Not-Child-Person:
Hey you completely ignored the last question I asked you!
